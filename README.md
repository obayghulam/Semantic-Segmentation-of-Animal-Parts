# 🐾 Semantic Segmentation of Animal Parts

This project implements **semantic segmentation** using a fine-tuned **U-Net model** to segment animal images into **5 distinct classes**: 
- Tail
- Body
- Legs
- Head
- Background

The system applies **deep learning-based segmentation techniques** to classify each pixel into its correct category.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Objective:** Segment animal images into 5 labeled parts.
- **Model:** Pretrained U-Net (Transfer Learning)
- **Classes:** Tail, Body, Legs, Head, Background
- **Techniques:** 
    - Image Preprocessing
    - U-Net Model Fine-Tuning
    - Semantic Segmentation Evaluation (e.g., IoU, Dice Coefficient)
